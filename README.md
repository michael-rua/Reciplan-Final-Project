ReciPlan
===
Reciplan was the final project that I worked on at Enspiral Dev Academy. I was in a team with Kyle Watson, Matt Silver, Aria Jones and Nimesh Govind. We made Reciplan in 6 days starting from scratch. Reciplan is a weekly meal planning app where you can add recipes to your collection, select which meal you want to eat on which day and then your shopping list is automatically built based on the ingredients that were in the recipes. It is designed for mobile first. We had a great time and will continue to support and develop the app as we feel there is more ffeatures that we can add to it. Reciplan is built with React-create-app, React, Bulma, Firebase. Utilising React Hooks and React Context API for state management.

To start in localhost:

npm install,

npm start

otherwise find it live at www.reciplan.co.nz
